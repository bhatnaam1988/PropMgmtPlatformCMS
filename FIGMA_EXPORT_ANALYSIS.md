## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### Conversion Process

**From React Router → Next.js App Router**

#### Changes Needed:

1. **File Structure Conversion**
```
React Router:          Next.js:
components/pages/      app/
  About.tsx         →    about/page.tsx
  Contact.tsx       →    contact/page.tsx
  Legal.tsx         →    legal/page.tsx
```

2. **Routing Conversion**
```tsx
// React Router
<Link to="/about">

// Next.js
import Link from 'next/link'
<Link href="/about">
```

3. **Client Components**
```tsx
// Add to top of files with interactivity
'use client';
```

4. **Remove Unused Imports**
```tsx
// Remove React Router
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

// Keep Next.js built-ins
import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';
```

5. **Image Optimization**
```tsx
// Replace
<img src="..." />

// With Next.js Image
import Image from 'next/image'
<Image src="..." width={} height={} alt="" />
```
